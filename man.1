POST

    ix.io/

        f:N    contents or attached file.
        id:N   id to replace. login required if used.
        name:N set filename (if f:N is not attached).
        ext:N  set filetype (eg .txt, if f:N is not attached).
        read:N set number of reads allowed before deletion.
        rm     id to delete. login required if used.

    where N is a unique number within request. (This allows you to post
    multiple files at once.)

    Use Basic-Auth to login. If the login does not exist, it will be created.
    Don't use an important password, this is not secure.

    returns: http://ix.io/id for N in request


PUT

    ix.io/ID
        replace ID. authentication required


DELETE

    ix.io/ID
        delete ID. authentication required


EXAMPLES

    Anonymous, unnamed paste, two ways:

        cat file.ext | curl -F 'f:1=<-' ix.io
        curl -F 'f:1=@file.ext' ix.io

    Nonymous, using .netrc for auth:

       curl -n -F 'f:1=@file.ext' ix.io

    Delete ID, two ways:

        curl -n -X DELETE ix.io/ID
        curl -F 'rm=ID' USER:PASS@ix.io

    Replace ID, two ways:

        curl -n -X PUT -F 'f:1=@file.ext' ix.io/ID
        cat file.ext | curl -F 'f:1=<-' -F 'id:1=ID' USER:PASS@ix.io

    Paste that can be only be read twice:

        cat file.ext | curl -F 'f:1=<-' -F 'read:1=2' ix.io


CLIENT

    A client is maintained at ix.io/client

        curl ix.io/client > ix
        chmod +x ix
        ./ix -h

    Or if you wish, paste the following function into $HOME/.bashrc:

        ix() {
            local opts
            local OPTIND
            [ -f "$HOME/.netrc" ] && opts='-n'
            while getopts ":hd:i:n:" x; do
                case $x in
                    h) echo "ix [-d ID] [-i ID] [-n N] [opts]"; return;;
                    d) $echo curl $opts -X DELETE ix.io/$OPTARG; return;;
                    i) opts="$opts -X PUT"; local id="$OPTARG";;
                    n) opts="$opts -F read:1=$OPTARG";;
                esac
            done
            shift $(($OPTIND - 1))
            [ -t 0 ] && {
                local filename="$1"
                shift
                [ "$filename" ] && {
                    curl $opts -F f:1=@"$filename" $* ix.io/$id
                    return
                }
                echo "^C to cancel, ^D to send."
            }
            curl $opts -F f:1='<-' $* ix.io/$id
        }

    Then open a new shell and type `ix -h`


CAVEATS:
    Paste at your risk. Be nice please. If you are distributing software that
    uses this automatically, talk to me first. If you are distributing malware
    please go away forever.

    The codebase for ix.io is intended to be free and open-source. It is not
    published at the moment because the author doesn't want to publish code
    that isn't pretty and pleasant (and is also deeply lazy about getting it
    there).

        Lots of changes to the bashrc function, and made a script version
        available at /client.
    20090911
        new client released (v0.4):
            * prompts for filename and filetype in interactive/pipe mode
            * more intuitive use of -i (-i ID FILE)
            * allow multiple deletes at the same time (-d ID -d ID2 ...)
            * allow multiple gets at the same time (-g ID -g ID2 ...)
    20090910
        Support deleting multiple items in one request
    20090801
        OK i'm hashing tokens in the db, looks like things still work.

        add id:N parameter, for replacing previous pastes (that you own)
        python client updated to v0.3 accordingly

TODO
    * allow anonymous, owned pastes. You own them and can delete them, but
      they don't show up in listings, and don't have sequential IDs.
